# Algorithm and Data Structure

## Time/Space Complexity

O(1) > O(log n) > O(n) > O(nlog n) > O(n^2) > O(n^3) > O(2^n)

## Fundametal Data Structures and Algorithms

### Store (Data Structure)

- Stack: FILO (First In Last Out)
- Queue: FIFO
- Tree
- Graph
- Linked list
- Array
- Dictionary

### Problem Solving Techniques

- Recursion
- Divide and conquer
- Brute Force
- Greedy Algorithms

## Databases

### Fundamental Requirements: ACID

ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability)

- **Atomicity**: means that an update happens to the database as a single, atomic event, so there are no partial updates.
- **Consistency**: means that in the event of a failure, for instance, an update failure, the database stays consistent with a known good state; this is usually the previous state of the database.
- **Isolation**: means that if there are multiple concurrent updates to the database, each transaction must not be intermixed with any other transaction.
- **Durability**: is like consistency; it means that in the event of a failure of the underlying database system, when the database system restarts, it is able to pick up where it left off and complete the transaction.

### Relation Data and SQL

- SQL is a standard language to describe these relationships between sets of data to extract meaningful data from a relational database.

- Relational databases mostly have structured data, data that is organized into rows and columns. This structured organization makes it easy to interact with the data using SQL and the set relations. (Schema)

- However, much of the data that we have in the world is not so easily structured. Unstructured data is data that cannot easily be organized into rows and columns, such as natural language text.

### NoSQL

- NoSQL or Not Only SQL is a collective name of a growing set of databases that apply different data structures besides tables of rows and columns used in relational databases.

Example:

- Graph DB: Neo4j
- Column Family DB: Bigtable and Cassandra
- Document DB: CouchDB and MongoDB
