# Programming

## Compile, Link and Load

Source code -> [***Compile***] -> Object Files -> [***Link***] -> Executable File -> [***Load***]

### Compile

- Input: Taking the assembly instructions and converting them to marchine language.
- Output:
  - Values of global variables.
  - The code.
  - A list of variables that should be initialize at 0.
  - References to functions that the compiler expect to come from other source (output from another compiler or from the OS)
- The binary files that the compiler generaates are called **object files**.

### Linker

  Takes multiple compiled **object files** and puts them together to create an **executable program** that can be loaded by a particular operating system.

  Linker's job is make sure all the references in the object files are resolved before generating the executable program.

- Static Library: linked directly in to the program (has to rebuild the app if library be updated)
- Dynami library: use OS calls to load dynamic library

### Loader

Loading and executing the program. Put the data and instructions in memory and update the instructions to use approciate memory locations.

It expects the program to be stored as a file on a media device (hard drive), in a specific format (executable file format)
