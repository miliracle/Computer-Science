# Programming

## Compile, Link and Load

Source code -> [***Compile***] -> Object Files -> [***Link***] -> Executable File -> [***Load***]

### Compile

- Input: Taking the assembly instructions and converting them to marchine language.
- Output:
  - Values of global variables.
  - The code.
  - A list of variables that should be initialize at 0.
  - References to functions that the compiler expect to come from other source (output from another compiler or from the OS)
- The binary files that the compiler generaates are called **object files**.

### Linker

  Takes multiple compiled **object files** and puts them together to create an **executable program** that can be loaded by a particular operating system.

  Linker's job is make sure all the references in the object files are resolved before generating the executable program.

- Static Library: linked directly in to the program (has to rebuild the app if library be updated)
- Dynamic library: use OS calls to load dynamic library

### Loader

Loading and executing the program. Put the data and instructions in memory and update the instructions to use approciate memory locations.

It expects the program to be stored as a file on a media device (hard drive), in a specific format (executable file format)

## Programming Paradigms

### Imperative Programming

Imperative Programming are constructed though a series of well-defined commands in a specific order, and the program flow is controlled by loops and branches.

Imperative Programs can be broken down to:

- Structured programming: add sequences, selection, and iteration operations to solve problems with nonstructured imperative programs.

- Procedural programming: divice the program into a small set of procedures, or functions.

- Modular programming: break down the program into a set of modules (files) that can be test independently of each other.

Example: COBOL, Pascal, ...

### Declarative Programming

With declarative programming, instead of programming based on the steps you go through to arrive at the solution, the program is written by describing the end result.

- Functional programming: pure function

Example:

```python
print( list( map( len, ["programming", "is", "fun"] ) ) )
```

It is easier to execute the operations in parallel. In this case, it’s possible to execute the “len” command for each parameter on a different CPU at the same time, which would be very fast!

Compare with imperative way:

```python
word_lengths = [0,0,0]
word_list = ["programming", "is", "fun"]
for i in range(len(word_list)):
    word_lengths[i] = len(word_list[i])
print(list(word_lengths))
```

The “for” loop operates each command sequentially, it’s not as easy for the system to execute the instructions in parallel.

### Object-Oriented Programming

Procedural programming that introduces some very important concepts:

- encapsulation
- abstraction
- inheritance
- polymorphism

### Interpreted Programming

Instead of compiling the source code into a executable file, we can use a program called an interperter execute it. Interperters are able to execute the high-level code instructions as they read then instead of compiling and linking into an executable program.

The interpreter itself is an executable program that reads the code and interacts with the OS to do what the code says.

### Parallel Programming
