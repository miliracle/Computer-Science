# Programming

## Compile, Link and Load

Source code -> [***Compile***] -> Object Files -> [***Link***] -> Executable File -> [***Load***]

### Compile

- Taking the assembly instructions and converting them to marchine language.
- The output:
  - Values of global variables.
  - The code.
  - A list of variables that should be initialize at 0.
  - References to functions that the compiler expect to come from other source (output from another compiler or from the OS)
- The binary files that the compiler generaates are called **object files**.

### Linker
